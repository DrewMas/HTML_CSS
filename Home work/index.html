                    <p>
                        Depp was born on June 9, 1963, in Owensboro, Kentucky, the youngest of four children of waitress Betty Sue Palmer (née Wells)
                        and civil engineer John Christopher Depp. Depp's family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in Miramar,
                        Florida in 1970. His parents divorced in 1978 when he was 15, and his mother later married Robert Palmer, whom Depp has called
                        "an inspiration". </p>
                    <p>
                        Depp was gifted a guitar by his mother when he was 12 years old, and began playing in various bands. He dropped out of Miramar
                        High School aged 16 in 1979 to become a rock musician. He attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal
                        told him to follow his dream of being a musician. In 1980, Depp began playing guitar in a band called The Kids. After modest
                        local success in Florida, the band moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method. In
                        addition to the band, Depp worked a variety of odd jobs, such as in telemarketing. In December 1983, Depp married make-up
                        artist Lori Anne Allison, the sister of his band's bassist and singer. The Kids split up before signing a record deal in 1984,
                        and Depp subsequently began collaborating with the band Rock City Angels. He co-wrote their song "Mary", which appeared on
                        their debut Geffen Records album Young Man's Blues. Depp and Allison divorced in 1985. </p>
